# Backlog

## Iteration +1
- Release 3.0.0 dev
- Release 3.0.0 GA
- Check if `tour.rst` is still valid. What about running it as a
  doctest, or converting it into a text-based notebook using MyST-NB?
- Document all extensions in `responder.ext`.
- Add `index.html` to standard `helloworld.py` example,
  so that the user does not receive a 404 Not Found.
