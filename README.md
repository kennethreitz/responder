Responder is powered by [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/).
[View documentation](https://responder.readthedocs.io).

Responder gets you an ASGI app, with a production static files server pre-installed,
Jinja templating, and a production webserver based on uvloop, automatically serving
up requests with gzip compression.
The `async` declaration within the example program is optional.

# Installing Responder

Install the most recent stable release:

    pip install --upgrade 'responder'

Include support for all extensions and interfaces:

    pip install --upgrade 'responder[full]'

Individual optional installation extras are:

- graphql: Adds GraphQL support via Graphene
- openapi: Adds OpenAPI/Swagger interface support

Install package with CLI and GraphQL support:

    uv pip install --upgrade 'responder[cli,graphql]'

Alternatively, install directly from the repository:

    pip install 'responder[full] @ git+https://github.com/kennethreitz/responder.git'

Responder supports **Python 3.7+**.

# The Basic Idea

The primary concept here is to bring the niceties that are brought forth from both Flask
and Falcon and unify them into a single framework, along with some new ideas I have. I
also wanted to take some of the API primitives that are instilled in the Requests
library and put them into a web framework. So, you'll find a lot of parallels here with
Requests.

- Setting `resp.content` sends back bytes.
- Setting `resp.text` sends back unicode, while setting `resp.html` sends back HTML.
- Setting `resp.media` sends back JSON/YAML (`.text`/`.html`/`.content` override this).
- Case-insensitive `req.headers` dict (from Requests directly).
- `resp.status_code`, `req.method`, `req.url`, and other familiar friends.

## Ideas

- Flask-style route expression, with new capabilities -- all while using Python 3.6+'s
  new f-string syntax.
- I love Falcon's "every request and response is passed into to each view and mutated"
  methodology, especially `response.media`, and have used it here. In addition to
  supporting JSON, I have decided to support YAML as well, as Kubernetes is slowly
  taking over the world, and it uses YAML for all the things. Content-negotiation and
  all that.
- **A built in testing client that uses the actual Requests you know and love**.
- The ability to mount other WSGI apps easily.
- Automatic gzipped-responses.
- In addition to Falcon's `on_get`, `on_post`, etc methods, Responder features an
  `on_request` method, which gets called on every type of request, much like Requests.
- A production static file server is built-in.
- Uvicorn built-in as a production web server. I would have chosen Gunicorn, but it
  doesn't run on Windows. Plus, Uvicorn serves well to protect against slowloris
  attacks, making nginx unnecessary in production.
- GraphQL support, via Graphene. The goal here is to have any GraphQL query exposable at
  any route, magically.
- Provide an official way to run webpack.
